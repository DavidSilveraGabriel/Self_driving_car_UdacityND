# Self_driving_car_UdacityND
Udacity nanodegree self driving car :D 

unfortunately due to personal and time problems. I will not be able to finish the udacity self driving car nanodegree, since I could only enter this course thanks to the free month that udacity granted for the COVID-19 problem, but so far..
I have managed to do 3 projects completed in just two weeks, that is a great achievement for me, since the average time to finish the course is 5 months and the limit is 6 months, which means that if I continued I could have successfully completed the course, such Some time in the future when I get a stable job I will enroll again in the course (I hope that in this future the course is updated xD) and complete it successfully !! 

in some weeks i will make a resume of the 3 projects that i do in this nanodegree ;)
